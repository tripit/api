    <h2 id="overview_section">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The TripIt Notification API allows a developer to receive a push
      notification from TripIt when a change occurs in a user's trips.
      By registering to receive such notifications and by implementing an HTTPS
      listener endpoint, the developer will receive the identity of the
      object that has changed so that he can retrieve the updated object
      and keep his system up to date with TripIt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subscribing to and unsubscribing from a user's trip changes is done with
      API calls that follow the same authentication and logical patterns as
      the other TripIt API endpoints. Every such request must be authenticated
      with OAuth in order to authorize the developer, and also to identify the
      user for which subscriptions are made.

    <h2 id="api_section">API Endpoints</h2>
    <h3>Subscribe</h3>
      <p>In order to subscribe to notification events for a user, call the "/v1/subscribe" endpoint in the TripIt API. The "subscribe" endpoint takes a single required parameter called "type". Currently, the only valid value for the "type" parameter is "trip".</p>
      <p>So as an example, in order to subscribe to a specific user's trip notification events, simply call, with the necessary OAuth authentication credentials, "/v1/subscribe/type/trip".</p>
    <h3>Unsubscribe</h3>
      <p>In order to unsubscribe from a user's notification events, call the "/v1/unsubscribe" endpoint in the TripIt API. The "unsubscribe" endpoint takes an optional parameter called "type". If specified, it indicates the type of notification from which to unsubscribe. If not specified, all notification subscriptions for the user are removed.</p>
    <h3>Callback URL</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, notifications may be subscribed to for changes to trip objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a change is made to a trip to which you are subscribed, TripIt will:w
      make a corresponding HTTP request to your server on a URL that you
      provide. In order to provide the URL to TripIt, contact api-support@tripit.com. Please include the application name, email address used to register the application, and the desired callback URL in the email.
    </p>
    <p>
      The URL is called with the following HTTP POST parameters:
      <ul>
        <li>type - The type of the object that was changed. Currently, this is always "trip". In the future additional types may be available, so this parameter should be checked.</li>
        <li>id - The TripIt ID of the object that was changed. If the object is a trip, for example, this ID may be used with the API to fetch the trip details.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
